## Description

The Face Detection with OpenCV script is a Python application that utilizes the OpenCV library for real-time face detection through a computer's webcam. The script captures video from the default camera, converts frames to grayscale, and applies a Haar cascade classifier to identify faces. Detected faces are highlighted with rectangles in the live video stream. With adjustable parameters for detection, the script provides a simple and interactive way to explore basic face recognition techniques. This lightweight and easy-to-understand tool serves as a starting point for understanding computer vision concepts and experimenting with facial detection in real-time scenarios.
